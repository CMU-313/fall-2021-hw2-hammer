  to ``DOCUMENTS_RECENTLY_CREATED_COUNT``. Config file migrations and

  manually updated.
- Document stubs without a label will now display their ID as the label.

- Improve proxy model menu link resolution. Proxy model don't need at least
  one bound link anymore to trigger resolution of all the parent model links.

  move them to different module when appropriate.
- Refactored the notification generation for efficiency, scalability and
  simplicity. Only users subscribed to events are queued for notifications.
  Content types of event targets and action objects is reused from the action
  model instead of gathering from inspection. Nested loop removed and lowered
  to a single loop.
- Optimize SourceColumn resolution. Support column exclusion for all object
  types. Ensure columns are not repeated when resolved even if they were
  defined multiple times. Improve docstring for the resolution logic in each
  level. Remove unused ``context`` parameter. Add SourceColumn tests.
- Support defining the default ``SearchModel``. This allows removing the hard
  coded search model name from the search template and allows third party
  apps to define their own default ``SearchModel``.
- Update MySQL Docker image from version 5.7 to 8.0. PostreSQL image from version
  10.14 to 10.15. Redis image from version 5.0 to 6.0.

- Standardize a class for the widgets of the class ``SourceColumn`` named
  ``SourceColumnWidget``.
- The cabinet view permission is now required for a document, to be able to
  view which cabinets contain that document. This change mirrors the
  permission layout of the metadata and tag apps.
- File caching now uses the same lock for all file methods. This ensures that
  a cache file that is being deleted or purge is not open for reading and
  vice versa.
- A method decorator was added to the lock manager app to ease usage of the
  same lock workflow in methods of the same class.
- The error handling of the ``CachePartitionFile`` methods was improved.
  This ensures proper clean up of stray storage files on model file creation
  error. The model now avoids accessing the model file for clean up on model
  file creation error, which would raise a hard to understand and diagnose
  missing file entry error. The model now avoids updating cache size on
  either model or storage file creation error.
- Support disabling form help texts via ``form_hide_help_text``.
- Docker image tagging layout has been updated. Images are tagged by version
  and series. Series have the 's' prefix and versions have the 'v' prefix.
- Added API endpoints for the Assets model.
- Added cached image generation for assets.
- Added asset detail view with image preview.
- Added a detail view for the cache model.
- Added the ``image_url`` field to the Workflow template serializer.

  template hook. This allows the autoadmin app to show login information
  without directly modifying the login template.
- Update tags app to improve user event tracking on view and API.
- Support deleting multiple document files.
- Track document file deletion event user in views.
- Rename ``setting_workflowimagecache_storage`` to
  ``setting_workflow_image_cache_storage_backend``.

  in list view mode. This behavior is controlled with the new settings:
  ``COMMON_COLLAPSE_LIST_MENU_LIST_FACET`` and
  ``COMMON_COLLAPSE_LIST_MENU_OBJECT``. Both default to ``False``.
- Added a check to the task manager app to ensure all defined tasks are
  properly configure in their respective ``queues.py`` modules.
- ACL apps updates: Add ACL deleted event, track action actor in API and
  views. Simply API views using REST API mixins. Update API views to return
  404 errors instead of 403, move global ACL list to the setup menu,
  model that are registered for ACLs are now also automatically register
  events in order to receive the ACL deleted event, improve tests and add more
  test cases.
- Update AddRemoveView to only call the underlying add or remove methods only
  if there are objects to act upon instead of calling the method with an
  empty queryset which would trigger unwanted events.
- Add ``ExternalContentTypeObjectAPIViewMixin`` to the REST API app. This
  mixin simplifies working with models that act upon another object via
  their Content Type, such as the ACLs.
- Update the ACL app to support multiple foreign object permission
  inheritance. Support for ``GenericForeignKey`` non default ``ct_field``,
  and ``fk_field`` was also added.
- Added support to export the global events list, object events list and
  user events list.
- Registering a model to receive events will cause it to have the object
  event view and object event subscription links bound too. This can
  be disabled with the `bind_links` argument. The default menu to bind the
  links is the "List facet". This can be changed via the ``menu`` argument.
- Change the format of the ``file_metadata_value_of`` helper. The driver
  and metadata entry are now separated by a double underscore instead of a
  single underscore. This allows supporting drivers and entries that might
  contain an underscore themselves.
- Add ``databases`` app to group data and models related code.
- Add class support for scoped searches. GitLab issue #875.
- Add sorting support to the API.
- Updated how the user interface column sorting works. The code was
  simplified by using a single query variable. The code was expanded
  to support multiple fields in the future. The URL query key used for
  column sorting was changed to match the API sorting.a
- Added the ``databases`` app. This app groups data and models related code.
- Added a patch for Django's ``Migration`` class to display time delta for
  each migration during development.
- Docker Compose updates:

    - Use profiles for extra containers.
    - Converted to use extensions to remove duplicated markup.
    - A new container was added to mount an index.
    - Added support for Traefik.
    - Added sample .env file.
    - Update required Docker Compose to version 1.28.

  filename of the uploaded file. This generator has the advantage of producing
  unique filename while also preserving the original filename for reference.
- Add support for the "Reply To" field for sending documents via email and
  for the mailing workflow actions. Closes GitLab issue #864. Thanks to
  Kevin Pawsey (@kevinpawsey) for the request.
- Allow customization of the error condition when generating document images.
  This allows displaying more icons in addition to the generic document
  image error with additional contextual information and popup messages
  explaining the actual error condition.
- Add key attributes to the document signature serializers. Forum topic 5085.
  Thanks to forum user @qra for the request.
- Added key attributes to the document signature model as calculated
  properties.
- Move detached signature upload from the created endpoint to a
  new /uploaded endpoint.
- Added document signature events.
- Refactored the workflows app.

    - Rebalance permissions needed to transition a workflow instance.
      The workflow instance transition permission is now needed for
      the document and for either the transition or the workflow.
    - Add more tests including trashed document tests.
    - Split API tests into instance and template tests.
    - Add `workflow-instance-log-entry-detail` end point.
    - Add parent URL fields to serializers.
    - Allow passing extra data when transitioning a workflow via the API.
    - Limit state options to workflow when using the API. This matches
      the UI behavior.

- Renamed the AddRemove view ``main_object_method_add`` to
  ``main_object_method_add_name`` and ``main_object_method_remove`` to
  ``main_object_method_add_remove_name``.
