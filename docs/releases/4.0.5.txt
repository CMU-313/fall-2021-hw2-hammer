Version 4.0.5
=============

Released: June 8, 2021

Changes
-------


Docker
^^^^^^

Support was added for changing Celery's maximum memory and maximum tasks per
worker. These setting help kill and re-spawn workers in a predictable
manner which helps reclaim lost memory due to memory leaks of the programs
executed by the background tasks. The environment variables
``MAYAN_WORKER_X_MAX_MEMORY_PER_CHILD`` and
``MAYAN_WORKER_X_MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD`` were added where ``_X_`` corresponds
to the respective worker.

Support was added for modifying Gunicorn's ``--limit-request-line`` setting
via the ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_LIMIT_REQUEST_LINE`` environment variable.

The Docker image environment variables chapter was improved. Some missing
environment variables were added. The default values were automated by taking
the values from the code. The environment variables were organized by topic.

A commented Docker compose port entry for the database was added.
Uncommenting this entry opens up the database port to the outside and allows
easier backups and management of the database.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The upgrade instructions of the release notes was converted into a partial
template that is now inserted into every release note instance. This helps
avoid errors and differences in the upgrade procedure of the releases of the
same series.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Several improvements were made to the document file and document version
page image generation.

The document version page base image cache invalidation on source image
transformation updates was improved. This fixes an edge case were changes
to the document file page were not being registered in the document version
page.

The transformation list generation of the document files and document versions
was optimized by replacing several loops with list extensions. The speed
increase is minimal per unit but since this segment of code is called we often
the effect is measurable.

The source content transformations are not longer used when calculating the
document version transformation list hash. This fixes an edge case where
the effect of some transformations was duplicated.

The way the document version page image API URL hash is generated was
improved to increase its uniqueness. This ensures browsers do not use a
cached document version page image when the transformations of the source
object of the version are updated.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

An error that was triggered by leaving empty a required metadata field
during the upload wizard was fixed


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

The trashed documents are now excluded from the workflow runtime proxy
document count column.
