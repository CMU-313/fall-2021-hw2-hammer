Version 3.0.2
=============

Released: August 16, 2018

Changes
-------

This bug fix release also includes a few tweaks to improve user experience.


Docker install script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Default to verbose.
- Increase startup timer from 5 to 10 seconds to give more time to users to
  examine the settings of the installation to be performed.
- Add support for configuring the PostgreSQL port. Useful when there are
  existing PostgreSQL installations.
- Docker install script: Detect if Docker installed and provide help
  text if not.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add deployment step that configures Redis to discard unused task data when
it runs out of memory. Redis is only used for volatile data therefore
configuring it to discard data doesn't affect functionality but increases
response time and reduced memory consumption.

The default timeout for gunicorn has been increased from from 30 to 120
seconds.

The code statistics and pending work chapters have been removed from the
documentation. The pending work list has been divided into a pending and a
planned feature list and moved to the new Wiki at wiki.mayan-edms.com

Builds
^^^^^^

Limit the number of branches that trigger the full test suit. Makes better use
of the amount of free continous integration available in GitLab.

- Mailer app: Add natural key support to the mailer app.
- Cabinets: Redirect to the cabinet list view after creating a new cabinet.
