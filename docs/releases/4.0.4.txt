Version 4.0.4
=============

Released: June 5, 2021

Changes
-------


Events
^^^^^^

Merged the following change from version 3.5.10:
Remove the database transaction handling in the event decorator. This caused
a race condition which made some background tasks like, workflows launches,
to attempt to access a document that was not yet available because it was
in the middle of an unfinished event transaction.
