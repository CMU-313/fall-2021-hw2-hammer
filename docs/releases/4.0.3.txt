Version 4.0.3
=============

Released: June 3, 2021

Changes
-------


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated dependency versions:

  - django-solo from version 1.1.3 to 1.1.5.
  - python-magic from version 0.4.15 to 0.4.22


Lock manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Renamed the ``get_instance()`` method to ``get_backend()``. This change
reflects the purpose of the method which is to return a class and not an
instance.

Added test for the ``purgelocks`` for all backends.

Added an optional ``_initialization`` method for backends. This allows
removing initialization code in the global scope.

Updated the ``RedisLock`` backend to use a connection pool. The connection
resides in the class scope and is available to all instances. Profiling
showed reduced connection and memory usage.


Makefile
^^^^^^^^

Unified Docker tests with staging targets. The staging targets now use
the same targets meant for testing.

Replaced underscore in target names with hyphen for uniformity. All target
names now use hyphens.

Added a Redis Docker container test targets.


Platform
^^^^^^^^

Updated the Docker entrypoint template to support default worker
concurrency values. The template now correctly passes the default concurrency
value of the D class worker. This lowers the number of workers, in turn
lowering the number of concurrent OCR processes for a reduction in CPU and
memory usage in default deployments.


REST API
^^^^^^^^

Updated the REST API examples for version 4 of the API.
