Version 4.0.2
=============

Released: May 25, 2021

Changes
-------

API
^^^

Some API endpoints that used parent-child resources were not working
correctly on some use cases when using token authentication, returning error
404 for valid requests. The API views now ensure that authentication has
completed before doing initial filtering on the parent resource.

The Django REST framework version was updated from version 3.11.0 to 3.11.2.


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

A solution for the longstanding issue of cabinet sorting was found. Cabinets
are a nested model and cannot be sorted properly with Django's queryset
sorting methods. Native tree sorting was implemented. This requires a rebuild
of the existing cabinet tree which is accomplished by an included migration.

The django-mptt library was updated from version 0.11.0 to 0.12.0.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PIP was updated from version 21.0.1 to 21.1.1.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several typos in the documentation were fixed. More context was added to some
upgrade steps.


Messaging
^^^^^^^^^

Support for marking messages as unread was added.

Opening a message will now mark it as read automatically.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The action dropdown template partial was moved to the navigation app.

Some unused and deprecated markup was removed.

The appearance of disabled action links was fixed.


Other
^^^^^

- Minor source string fixes.
