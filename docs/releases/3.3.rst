Version 3.3
===========

Released: XX XX, 2019


Changes
-------

- Add support for icon shadows.
- Add icons and no-result template to the object error log view and
  links.
- Use Select2 widget for the document type selection form.
- Backport the vertical main menu update. This update splits the previous
  main menu into a new menu in the same location as the previous one
  now called the top bar, and a new vertical main menu on the left side.
  The vertical menu remain open even when clicking on items and upon
  a browser refresh will also restore its state to match the selected
  view.
- Backport workflow preview refactor. GitLab issue #532.
- Add support for source column inheritance.
- Add support for source column exclusion.
- Backport workflow context support.
- Backport workflow transitions field support.
- Backport workflow email action.
- Backport individual index rebuild support.
- Rename the installjavascript command to installdependencies.
- Remove database conversion command.
- Remove support for quoted configuration entries. Support unquoted,
  nested dictionaries in the configuration. Requires manual
  update of existing config.yml files.
- Support user specified locations for the configuration file with the
  CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH (MAYAN_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH environment variable), and
  CONFIGURATION_LAST_GOOD_FILEPATH
  (MAYAN_CONFIGURATION_LAST_GOOD_FILEPATH environment variable) settings.
- Move bootstrapped settings code to their own module in the smart_settings apps.
- Remove individual database configuration options. All database configuration
  is now done using MAYAN_DATABASES to mirror Django way of doing database setup.
- Added support for YAML encoded environment variables to the platform
  templates apps.
- Move YAML code to its own module. Code now resides in common.serialization
  in the form of two new functions: yaml_load and yaml_dump.
- Move Django and Celery settings. Django settings now reside in the smart
  settings app. Celery settings now reside in the task manager app.
- Backport FakeStorageSubclass from versions/next. Placeholder class to allow
  serializing the real storage subclass to support migrations.
  Used by all configurable storages.
- Support checking in and out multiple documents.
- Remove encapsulate helper.
- Add support for menu inheritance.
- Emphasize source column labels.

Removals
--------

- Database conversion. Reason for removal. The database conversions support
  provided by this feature (SQLite to PostgreSQL) was being confused with
  database migrations and upgrades.
  
  Database upgrades are the responsibility of the app and the framework.
  Database conversions however are not the responsibility of the app (Mayan),
  they are the responsibility of the framework.
  
  Database conversion is outside the scope of what Mayan does but we added
  the code, management command, instructions and testing setup to provide
  this to our users until the framework (Django) decided to add this
  themselves (like they did with migrations).

  Continued confusion about the purpose of the feature and confusion about 
  how errors with this feature were a reflexion of the code quality of
  Mayannecessitated the removal of the database conversion feature.

Upgrading from a previous version
---------------------------------

If installed via Python's PIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remove deprecated requirements::

    sudo -u mayan curl https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/raw/master/removals.txt -o /tmp/removals.txt && sudo -u mayan /opt/mayan-edms/bin/pip uninstall -y -r /tmp/removals.txt

Type in the console::

    /opt/mayan-edms/bin/pip install mayan-edms==3.3

the requirements will also be updated automatically.


Using Git
^^^^^^^^^

If you installed Mayan EDMS by cloning the Git repository issue the commands::

    git reset --hard HEAD
    git pull

otherwise download the compressed archived and uncompress it overriding the
existing installation.

Remove deprecated requirements::

    pip uninstall -y -r removals.txt

Next upgrade/add the new requirements::

    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt


Common steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perform these steps after updating the code from either step above.

Make a backup of your supervisord file::

    sudo cp /etc/supervisor/conf.d/mayan.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/mayan.conf.bck

Update the supervisord configuration file. Replace the environment
variables values show here with your respective settings. This step will refresh
the supervisord configuration file with the new queues and the latest
recommended layout::

    sudo MAYAN_DATABASES="{'default':{'ENGINE':'django.db.backends.postgresql','NAME':'mayan','PASSWORD':'mayanuserpass','USER':'mayan','HOST':'127.0.0.1'}}" \
    MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=/opt/mayan-edms/media \
    /opt/mayan-edms/bin/mayan-edms.py platformtemplate supervisord > /etc/supervisor/conf.d/mayan.conf

Edit the supervisord configuration file and update any setting the template
generator missed::

    sudo vi /etc/supervisor/conf.d/mayan.conf

Migrate existing database schema with::

    sudo -u mayan MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=/opt/mayan-edms/media /opt/mayan-edms/bin/mayan-edms.py performupgrade

Add new static media::

    sudo -u mayan MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=/opt/mayan-edms/media /opt/mayan-edms/bin/mayan-edms.py preparestatic --noinput

The upgrade procedure is now complete.
