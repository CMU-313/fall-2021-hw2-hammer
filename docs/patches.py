    Monkey patch docutil's Include directive to support global substitutions.

    inserting it back, so we add a call to our own transformation
    method. We patch the base Include class, recreate Sphinx's Include class,
    and register it as the new main include directive.
    All this avoids copy and paste of the original code here.
