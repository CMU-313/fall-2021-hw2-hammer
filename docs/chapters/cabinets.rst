Cabinets
========

Cabinets are a multi-level method to organize documents. Each cabinet can
contain documents as well as other sub level cabinets. Cabinets can
be added from the :menuselection:`Cabinets --> Add new` menu.

With a cabinet structure created, the next step is to add documents to them.
To add documents to a cabinet, select the cabinet tab of a document, and
select :menuselection:`Actions --> Add to cabinets` link.

Documents can also be added in bulk to one or more cabinets from any view
that lists documents.
