Cabinets
========

Cabinets are a multi-level method to organize documents. Each cabinet can
contain documents as well as other sub level cabinets.

With a cabinet structure created, the next step is to add documents to them.

Documents can also be added in bulk to one or more cabinets from any view
that lists documents.
