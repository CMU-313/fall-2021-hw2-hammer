Tags
====

Tags are color coded properties that can be attached or removed from documents.
Tags allow giving documents a binary property. Documents can also be tagged
with more than one tag.

Once tagged, documents can be searched by their tags. It is also possible to
show all the documents tagged with a particular
tag via the **Documents** link of each tag.

To view, add, or remove tags from a specific document, go to the document view
and click on the **Tags** tab. This view will show the current tags of a
document. The **Actions** menu will now show two new options: one to attach
more tags to the document and another to remove tags from the document.

It is also possible to tag documents in bulk by selecting several documents
from any view that displays a list documents and selecting the **Attach tag**
or **Remove tags** from the dropdown menu.
