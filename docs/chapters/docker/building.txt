==================
Building the image
==================

Clone the repository with::

    git clone |SOURCE_CODE_GIT|

Change to the directory of the cloned repository::

    cd mayan-edms

Execute Docker's build command using the provided makefile::

    make docker-build

Or using an APT cache to speed up the build::

    make docker-build-with-proxy APT_PROXY=172.17.0.1:3142

Replace the IP address `172.17.0.1` with the IP address of the computer
running the APT proxy and caching service.
