Nightly images
==============

The continuous integration pipeline used for testing development builds also
produces a resulting Docker image. These are build automatically and their
stability is not guaranteed. They should never be used in production.
If you want to try out the Docker images the development uses or want a sneak
peek at the new features being worked on checkout the container registry at:
