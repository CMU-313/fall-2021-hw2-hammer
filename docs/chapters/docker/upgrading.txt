Upgrading
=========

Upgrading a Mayan EDMS Docker container is actually a matter of stopping and
deleting the container, downloading the most recent version of the image and
starting a container again. The container will take care of updating the
database structure to the newest version if necessary.

**IMPORTANT!** Do not delete the volume storing the data, only the container.

Stop the container to be upgraded::

    docker stop mayan-edms


Remove the container::

    docker rm mayan-edms


Pull the new image version::

    docker pull mayanedms/mayanedms:latest


Start the container again with the new image version::

    docker run -d --name mayan-edms --restart=always -p 80:8000 -v /docker-volumes/mayan:/var/lib/mayan mayanedms/mayanedms:latest
