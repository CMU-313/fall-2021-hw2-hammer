Environment Variables
=====================

The common set of settings can also be modified via environment variables when
using the Docker image. In addition to the common set of settings, some Docker
image specific environment variables are available.

``MAYAN_SETTINGS_MODULE``

Optional. Allows loading an alternate settings file.


``MAYAN_GUNICORN_TIMEOUT``

Optional. Changes the amount of time the frontend worker will wait for a
request to finish before raising a timeout error. The default is 120
seconds.

``MAYAN_GUNICORN_WORKERS``

Optional. This environment variable controls the number of frontend workers
that will be executed. If not specified the default is 2. For heavier loads,
user a higher number. A formula recommended for this setting is the number
of CPU cores + 1.

``MAYAN_WORKER_FAST_CONCURRENCY``

Optional. Changes the concurrency (number of child processes) of the Celery
worker consuming the queues in the fast (low latency, short tasks) category.
Default is 1. Use 0 to disable hardcoded concurrency and allow the Celery
worker to launch its default number of child processes (equal to the number
of CPUs detected).

``MAYAN_WORKER_MEDIUM_CONCURRENCY``

Optional. Changes the concurrency (number of child processes) of the Celery
worker consuming the queues in the medium (medium latency, long running tasks)
category. Default is 1. Use 0 to disable hardcoded concurrency and allow the
Celery worker to launch its default number of child processes (equal to the
number of CPUs detected).

``MAYAN_WORKER_SLOW_CONCURRENCY``

Optional. Changes the concurrency (number of child processes) of the Celery
worker consuming the queues in the slow (high latency, very long running tasks)
category. Default is 1. Use 0 to disable hardcoded concurrency and allow the
Celery worker to launch its default number of child processes (equal to the
number of CPUs detected).

``MAYAN_USER_UID``

Optional. Changes the UID of the ``mayan`` user internal to the Docker
container. Defaults to 1000.

``MAYAN_USER_GID``

Optional. Changes the GID of the ``mayan`` user internal to the Docker
container. Defaults to 1000.
