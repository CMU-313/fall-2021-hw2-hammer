Tags are color coded properties that can be attached or removed from documents.
Tags allow giving documents a binary property. Documents can also be tagged
with more than one tag.

Once tagged, documents can be searched by their tags. It is also possible to
show all the documents tagged with a particular
tag via the **Documents** link of each tag.
