A comment field is also provided to allow users 
to summarize the new verdion changes in comparison with the previous 
one.  If a new version was uploded by mistake or such new version is no 
longer necessary **Mayan EDMS** provides the option to revert to a previous 
version of the document.

To upload a new document version, select an existing document, click on the 
version tab of the document, and click on the 'upload new version' on the 
side bar.  A new view very similar to the new document upload view will 
appear show the same interactive document sources that have been defined, 
but with new options to specify the new version number and an optional  
comment.
