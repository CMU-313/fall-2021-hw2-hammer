Transformations
===============

Transformation are persistent manipulations to the previews of the stored
documents. For example: a scanning equipment may only produce landscape PDFs.
In this case an useful transformation for that document source would be to
rotate all documents scanned by 270 degrees after being uploaded, this way
whenever a document is uploaded from that scanner it will appear in portrait
orientation. Transformations do not physically modify the document file but
are just associated with the document's temporary graphical representation.
