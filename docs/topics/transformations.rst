=========================
What are transformations?
=========================

Transformation are useful to manipulate the preview of the stored documents
in a persistent manner, for example some scanning equipment only produce
landscape PDFs, in this case a default transformation for that document
source would be "rotation: 270 degress", this way whenever a document is
uploaded from that scanner it appears in portrait orientation.
The transformation remains attached to the document, this way the file
is preserved in it's original state (a requirement in legal environments)
but only the representation is transformed to make it look right to the user.
