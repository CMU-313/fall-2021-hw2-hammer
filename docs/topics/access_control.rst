Access control
##############

Mayan EDMS uses a role based permission system
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) that provides a
mechanism to control access to the contained documents and system functions.

The role access control system is divided into two main groups:

* Permission grants to roles for the entire system.
* ACLs (access control lists). These are permission granted to a role for a
  specific object or group of objects.
