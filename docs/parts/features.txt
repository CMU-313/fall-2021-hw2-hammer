Features
========

- Free open source software.

  - :doc:`Very permissive license compatible with commercial usage <../parts/license>`.
  - Use as-is or add your own customizations.
  - Sell your own services or custom code.

- :doc:`Document versioning <../chapters/versioning>`.

  - Store many versions of the same document, download or revert to a
    previous version.

- :doc:`Digital signatures <../chapters/signatures>`.

  - Check the authenticity of documents by verifying their embedded
    cryptographic signatures or upload detached signatures for document
    signed after they were stored.

- :doc:`User-defined document metadata <../chapters/metadata>`.

  - Several metadata fields can be matched to a document type as per technical,
    legal or structural requirements such as the `Dublin core`_ or `ISO 23081`_
    just to name a few.
  - Metadata fields can have an initial value, which can be static or determined
    by a template code snippet provided by the user.

- :doc:`Documents can be uploaded from different sources <../chapters/sources>`.

  - Local file or server side file uploads, multifunctional copier, or even via
    email.

- Precision engineering.

  - Multi disciplinary team with decades of enterprise system engineering
    and enterprise software development experience.
  - Complex design changes are documented via a formal processes called
    :ref:`mercs`.

- :doc:`Advanced access control system <../chapters/permissions>`.

  - Role based access control. It is possible to create an unlimited amount
    of different roles not being restricted to the traditional admin,
    operator, guest paradigm.
  - There is a permission for every atomic operation performed by users.

- Previews for many file formats.

  - Mayan EDMS provides image preview generation for many popular file
    formats.

- Office document format support.

  - Mayan EDMS can detect the presence of LibreOffice and use it to support
    word processing files, spreadsheets and presentations.

- Full text searching.

  - Documents can be searched by their text content, their metadata or any other
    file attribute such as name, extension, etc.

- :doc:`Configurable document grouping <../parts/categorization>`.

  - Automatic linking of documents based on metadata values or document
    properties.

- :doc:`Automatic OCR processing <../chapters/ocr_backend>`.

  - The task of transcribing text from documents via OCR can be distributed
    among several physical or virtual computers to decrease load and increase
    availability.
  - The current language of the document is passed to the corresponding OCR
    engine to increase the text recognition rate.

- Multilingual user interface.

  - Mayan EDMS being written using the Django_ framework, can be translated
    to practically any language spoken in the world. For a list of translated
    languages have a look at the Transifex_ project location.

- :doc:`Plugable storage backends <../parts/storage>`.

  - Built in support for file system storage.
  - It is very easy to use 3rd party plugins such as the ones available for
    Amazon EC2.
  - Use cloud object storage like S3 or on premise using Minio.

- :doc:`Workflows <../chapters/workflows>`.

  - Keep track of the state of documents, along with the log of the previous
    state changes.
  - Use the workflow engine to automate business processes by executing
    system actions.
  - Trigger external processes using the workflow. Execute actions in other
    systems when a document hits a specific state for complete business
    automation.

- :doc:`Non destructive page remapping and disabling <../releases/4.0>`.

  - Change the order of the pages of the files uploaded to a document or
    disable them to remove them from view. Pages from multiple document files
    can also be joined or appended to create multiple document versions from
    the same set of files.

- Automatic duplicate document scanning.

  - Extensible system to allow for specific duplication search criteria. By
    default, backends are supplied to scan for documents with exact files and
    exact labels.

- Complete event tracking system.

  - Every action performed in the system is recorded, perfect for auditing.
  - Users and other apps can subscribe to events to perform actions or
    provide notifications.

- :doc:`Non destructive image transformations <../chapters/transformations>`.

  - Multi layer image support. Each layer can support different permission
    layout to restrict image manipulation to different roles.
  - Rotate, crop, flip images to correct bad scans.
  - Every transformation can be undone and never modifies the uploaded file.
  - User overlays to add privacy makers to internal documents not meant for
    printing.
  - Add redaction to hide sensitive information before publication.

- Configurable authentication system.

  - Take advantage of the default username or email authentication backends
    provided for a quick deployment or install your own.
  - Can extended to support single sign on, LDAP, or other protocols.

- Automatic extraction of file metadata.

  - In addition to the metadata defined by your organization, make use of the
    built in metadata available in many file formats.
  - Extra author information, camera settings used to take a photo, or even
    GPS coordinates.
  - Extracted file metadata can be used in other apps of the system to do
    things like automatic categorization by GPS coordinates.

- Can be deploy in many different environments, vendors, hardware.

  - Do a direct Python installation for maximum control and performance.
  - Use the official `Docker image`_ for easier installation and scalability.
  - Deploy to a virtual machine, direct hardware, public cloud, private
    cloud, or a single board computer.
  - Has been successfully deployed to IBM cloud, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean,
    and Azure. Either using Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Machine, and
    Kubernetes.

- Scalable as a design principle.

  - Grow your document repository without future capacity concern.
  - Extensive regression testing ensures each version is faster than the
    previous one.
  - Default installation scales to hundred of thousand of documents.
  - Tuned installations scale to millions of documents.

- :doc:`Color coded tags <../chapters/tags>`.

  - Labeled and color coded tags can be assigned for intuitive recognition.

- Batch uploads.

  - Many documents can be upload in a single action.
  - Clone a document's metadata for speedier uploads and eliminate repetitive
    data entry.

- :doc:`Collaboration tools <../parts/collaboration>`.

  - Discuss documents, or comment on new versions of a document.

- Multi page document support.

  - Multiple page PDF, office files, and TIFF files are supported.
