------

Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level
virtualization also known as containerization. It allows independent
"containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead
of starting and maintaining virtual machines (VMs).

   Docker is with Docker Compose. The installation script at
